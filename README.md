# Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow

Using ["Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow" book](https://www.manning.com/books/data-pipelines-with-apache-airflow), written by Bas Harenslak and Julian de Ruiter, this repo tracks my journey to getting familiar with this technology. Most code comes from the authors so please buy their book for more context!
